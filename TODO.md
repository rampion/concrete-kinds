· Write up usage, documentation
  - "alternative" to `categories` (qualified imports as a way to use both together)
  - "default" natural arrows at given concrete kinds

· Integrate stuff from `PolyKindedData.hs`
· Integrate stuff from `Free.hs`
· `Free` as free implementation of many classes, not just `Monad`
· see if generalizing type extension pattern is possible

· copy `Control.Category.Dual` from `categories`
· see if there's anything else from `categories` we should also provide
